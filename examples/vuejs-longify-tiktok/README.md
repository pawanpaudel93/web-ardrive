<h1 align="center">Welcome to longify-tiktok</h1>
<hr/>

A VUE webapp to make videos appear to be shorter by modifying the underlying duration metadata so that longer videos can be uploaded to websites like TikTok. Both mp4/webm video files are supported.

## Demo Website
[LongifyTikTok](https://longifytiktok.herokuapp.com/ "LongifyTikTok")
[Arweave Devnet URL](https://arweave.net/V6auzBHQVWe0MD7jPZlD6CHmC4Lf5-kBE0_DT9Yo5Ro)

You can also checkout cli/package version similar to this webapp written in Python: [tiktok-long-video](https://github.com/pawanpaudel93/tiktok-long-video "tiktok-long-video")

## Proof

  This video [https://www.tiktok.com/@harrynepal26/video/6917917976008183042](https://www.tiktok.com/@harrynepal26/video/6917917976008183042 "https://www.tiktok.com/@harrynepal26/video/6917917976008183042") is actually 2 Minutes 45 Seconds long.
  You can download this video using [govue-tiktok-downloader](https://github.com/pawanpaudel93/govue-tiktok-downloader "govue-tiktok-downloader") to confirm that video is more than 60 seconds long.

## Usage

To upload longer videos than 60 seconds to TikTok, first you must have a webm/mp4 video file or you can convert the video to webm/mp4 using online or offline tools and then you can upload your video files to this repo demo website and get modified version of the video which seems to be 5secs long but actually its longer than 5secs.
